# Codeforces in Python 🐍

This repo contains my Python solutions to Codeforces problems.  
I use it mainly to track my progress, learn from mistakes, and improve my problem-solving speed.

My solutions aren’t perfect. If you have any (literally any) suggestions, your obligated to give comments or suggestions that could help me improve.

## How I Work

- During contests, I solve each problem (A, B, C…) in separate scripts.
- For practice, I add standalone problems by their code (e.g., `problemname_1234A.py`).
- I reuse a small template and helper functions to save time during contests.

## Tips + Notes

- **Input/Output**: I often rely on `sys.stdin.readline` for speed.
- **Testing**: I keep sample inputs in `input.txt` and run with:
  ```bash
  python solution.py < input.txt
  ```
